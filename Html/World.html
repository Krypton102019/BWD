<h1 class="title">Hello World</h1>
<p class="sth">The ancient root of world meant ‘age or life of man’. The first part is the same as were- in werewolf (see wolf)—it means ‘man’—and the second part is related to old. 
     The Anglo-Saxons first used world to mean ‘human existence, life on earth’ as opposed to future life in heaven or hell.
     America was first called the New World in 1555, and Europe, Asia, and Africa the Old World at the end of that century.
    
    Olde worlde is a ‘fake’ antiquated spelling for old-fashioned things intended to be quaint and attractive, and dates only from the 1920s. 
    <br>
    The developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America were initially known as the Third World in the 1950s by French writers who used tiers monde, ‘third world’, to distinguish the developing countries from the capitalist and Communist blocs. 
    <br> The first use in English came in 1963.

    <h1><u>Organisms that live on the earth</u></h1>
    <p>There are different types of organisms, including -producers, consumers, herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, scavengers, parasites, predators, and decomposers.

        Also Read: Food web
        <ul>
       <li> Producers – An organism that produces their own food with the help of raw materials are called as the Producers. All green plants and algae, which synthesize their food 
        through the biological process called photosynthesis are examples of Producers.</li>
        <br>
        
        
       <li> Consumers– An organism which completely depends on plants or other animals for their food are called as the Consumers. All carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores are examples of Consumers</li>
        
        
        <li>Herbivores– An organism which only feeds on grass, herbs, leaves, fruits and other parts of plants are called as the Herbivores. Elephant, deer, giraffe, monkey, rhinoceros are the example of Herbivores.</li>
        <li> Carnivores– An organism which feeds on the flesh of the other animals are called as the Carnivores. These animals eat only by hunting and killing other animals. Tiger, lion, cheetah, leopard are the example of Carnivores.</li>
        
    
        <li>Omnivores– An organism which feeds on both the plants and animals are called as the Omnivores. Bears, racoons, crows are examples of Omnivores.</li>
    </ul>
        
        Also, read Omnivores
     <ul> 
        <li> Scavengers– An organism that feeds on dead and decaying biomass is called as the scavengers. They play an important role in our ecosystem by keeping the environment clean by consuming dead animal and plant material. Vulture, racoon, crow, fox are examples of scavengers.</li>
        
        <li> Parasites – An organism that completely depends on its host for their survival are called as the Parasites. These organisms live within or on the body of an individual, obtain their food and cause harm to the host cells. Tapeworms and fleas are examples of parasites</li>
        
            <li> Predators– An organism which hunts and kills their prey for their food is called as the Predators. All wild animals are examples of Predators. Lion hunt for deer and zebra, fox hunts for rabbit, etc.</li>
        
        Also, read Predators
        
     <li> Decomposers – An organism which feeds by breaking down the dead and decaying organic matter. Fungi and few worms are examples of Decomposers.</li>
    </ul>
